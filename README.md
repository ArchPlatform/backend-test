# README

For this challenge, we would like you to build a simple API that return information about workstations managed by our platform.

## Getting Started 

This project uses ruby-2.6.2.

1. Install ruby dependancies with `bundle install`
2. Run the webserver `bundle exec rails s -p 3005`
3. Access the API on `http://localhost:3005`

We recommend using Postman to access the API.

## Step 1: Implement `/workstations/x` show API endpoint

A `Workstation` represents a cloud workstation. Workstations are assigned to one or more `User`s who can allowed to access the workstation.

Create an endpoint that will return the JSON representation of a `Workstation`, given a `Workstation``ID`. The response format should follow the JSON API spec.

The response format should follow the [JSON API spec](http://jsonapi.org/examples/)

The `Workstation` and `User` classes have already been defined and both include a DATA constant that contains the data about each record.

```json
/workstations/101
  
{
  "data": {
    "type": "workstation",
    "id": "101",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Dave's workstation",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
      "status": "running",
      "instanceType": "g3.4xlarge",
      "platform": "linux"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "users": {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": 101,
            "type": "user"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

API allows you to include related entities, so the following request should return the following response:

```json
/workstations/101?include=users

{
  "data": {
    "type": "workstation",
    "id": "101",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Dave's workstation",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
      "status": "running",
      "instanceType": "g3.4xlarge",
      "platform": "linux"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "users": {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": 101,
            "type": "user"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": 101,
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Dave N.",
        "email": "dave@gmail.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Implement `/workstations` index API endpoint

Building on step 1, implement an endpoint that returns all workstations following the JSON API specification.

The `include` parameter should also work, returning each user that is related to the returned workstations.

```json
/workstations?include=users

{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "workstation",
      "id": "101",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Dave's workstation",
        "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
        "status": "running",
        "instanceType": "g3.4xlarge",
        "platform": "linux"
      },
      "relationships": {
        "users": {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": 101,
              "type": "user"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "workstation",
      "id": "102",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Simon's workstation",
        "ipAddress": "192.168.1.2",
        "status": "running",
        "instanceType": "g3.4xlarge",
        "platform": "linux"
      },
      "relationships": {
        "users": {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": 102,
              "type": "user"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": 101,
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Dave N.",
        "email": "dave@gmail.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "user",
      "id": 102,
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Simon L.",
        "email": "simon@gmail.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Things to keep in mind:
* What should happen if an invalid Workstation ID is provided?
* What should happen if we pass an invalid `include` parameter
* How can we be sure that everything is working?

# Notes
* You can use any gems that you like, but don't use any library that actually solves the problem itself (e.g. `jsonapi-resources` or `fast-jsonapi` or `active_model_serializers`)
* This shouldn't take more than a few hours. If you don't have time to complete it, don't worry - we're much more interested in how you approach the problem.
* If you want to provide more background on how you would have completed the problem, or any other notes, please put them in a NOTES.md file at the root of the project.
* Use an app like Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) to send requests to the API during development rather than using your browser.
